<h2 align = "center"> ABOUT ME</h2>	

<p>Howdy! My name is Casey Sorsdal. I'm a nimble-witted computing student at Texas A&M University, minoring in Statistics with a concentration in Statistical Data Visualization, and I have a ton of interest in game development. In both technical and managerial roles, I've helped manage international teams to generate millions in revenue and secure over 30 million unique downloads. As a manager, I have collaborated with high-profile clients like Microsoft, St. Jude's, Minecraft, Xbox, BoomTV, and Verizon, administering events and experiences that are seen by millions of viewers. I currently work part-time at Starfish Studios, a company that creates unique experiences in Minecraft in direct partnership with Microsoft, as a Release and Project Manager. My role involves ensuring the quality of all our products before release, maintaining close contact with Microsoft, and working on feedback they may provide after we submit our content to them. Alongside this, I help ideate, plan, and create all our projects, working closely with the team to ensure consistent progress as we stride toward our goal. Before I delve more into my job, let me take a step back. My interest in programming skyrocketed in 2019, as COVID began to make its rounds. A good online friend reached out to me with a task: "Let's make a Minecraft mod." After about six months of learning Java, 3D modeling, and reigniting the pixel art skills I had learned years ago, we finished our first mod. A few months after its release, it had blown up, jumping from around 2,000 downloads to well over a million. It's safe to say I had gotten quite a bit of attention from it. Things began to move very quickly. I was partnering and working alongside creators on fun projects that I had idolized all my life. Opportunities continued to present themselves until I received a message: a part-time, paid offer for a company that worked directly with Minecraft and Microsoft. All I had to do was interview for it. I acted fast, accepting the position where I soon began as a 2D and 3D artist. Interestingly, I did not start as a developer, nor a manager. Though, eventually, I built up great relationships with my bosses where I worked my way into a managerial position two years later. I still do not do much programming or development, so why computer science? I want to further my knowledge in programming. Computer science has always been an interest of mine, and in my work, I feel like I contribute to every aspect except programming. Eventually, I want to have enough technical capability to manage each aspect of a game development team and have a good understanding of each part to effectively lead teams in creating games. Now, I am proud to say that I excel in a variety of programming languages, including Java, Python, HTML, CSS, and C++, while also having a unique interest in 2D/3D design. On top of my job, I run and manage marketing for Gents of Texas A&M, a popular men's organization on campus at Texas A&M.
