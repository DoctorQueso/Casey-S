					<h2 align = "center"> BUILD AGAINST CANCER</h2>
					<p>I helped create, ideate, and also administrate a live Minecraft event in partnership with St. Jude's and popular Youtube streamer Dr Lupo! In total, we helped raise over a million dollars for charity. The entire event was broadcasted and livestreamed over a 24 hour long period. Me and three others were in charge of making sure the 12 hour total Minecraft period went smoothly. Our small team created fun games, amongst other things to keep viewers entertained and engaged for the charity event. </p>
